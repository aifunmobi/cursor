# PWA Setup Instructions

## Icon Files Required

For full PWA functionality, you need to add two icon files:

1. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These icons will be used when users install the app on their devices.

### Quick Icon Generation

You can create simple icons using:
- Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Or use a simple colored square with the app name

The icons should:
- Be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Use the theme color (#61dafb) or complementary colors
- Be recognizable at small sizes
